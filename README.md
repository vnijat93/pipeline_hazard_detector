# MIPS Pipeline Hazard Detector

Final project for Syracuse University CIS655, Spring 2022

To use this program:
1. clone the repo to your local computer.
2. Run `pipenv install` to install all dependencies
2. Export your flask app: `export FLASK_APP=detector.py`
3. Start the server `flask run`
4. The address should be `127.0.0.1/5000`


A program that can take selected(TBD) instructions from traditional MIPS and detect the pipelining hazards and generates the timing sequence.
